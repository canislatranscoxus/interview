/*
before start looking at data we must develop some hypothesis.

What is the purpose of search? 
Find people, groups, conversations, products

How would you know if it is fulfilling that purpose? 

* one way could be, ask for user feedback, did you find what you are searching (yes / no) ?

* if user click any of the recommended links, we can asume purpose is fullfilled, other case no.



How might you (quantitatively) understand the general quality of 
an individual user's search experience?

user can give a score to the search, from 1 to 5 stars.
