problem 3.6. : Animal Shelter

An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly
"first in, first out" basis. People must adopt either the "oldest" 
(based on arrival time) of all animals at the shelter, or they can select 
wheather they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal
of that type ). They cannot select which specific animal they would like.
Create the data structure to maintain this system and implement operations
such as enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog, and dequeueCat. You may use 
the built-in Linked list data structure.
